    <h3>Cranberry Sauce Muffins</h3>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Flour:</b> Two cups of all-purpose flour give these leftover cranberry sauce muffins structure.
        </li>
        <li><b>Sugar:</b> Use a combination of white and brown sugar for ultimate sweetness.</li>
        <li><b>Baking Powder:</b> Baking powder acts as a leavener, which means it makes the batter 
            rise and creates a fluffy texture.
        </li>
        <li><b>Spices and flavoring:</b> These cozy muffins are flavored with cinnamon, cardamom,
             a pinch of salt, and vanilla extract.
        </li>
        <li><b>Leftova cranberry sauce:</b> You can use homemade or store-bought cranberry sauce.
        </li>
        <li><b>Milk:</b> Any milk you have on hand is fine, from regular whole milk to your favorite
             alternative milk. Some reviewers suggest substituting orange juice.
        </li>
        <li><b>Oil:</b> Vegetable oil adds moisture without imparting any flavor.
        </li>
        <li><b>Egg:</b> One whole egg adds structure, richness, and moisture.
        </li>
    </ul> <br><br>
